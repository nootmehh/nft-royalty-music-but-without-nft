🎯 Problem: The distribution of performing rights royalties for musicians is non-transparent, slow, and inefficient, causing many song creators to not receive fair compensation when their works are played in public venues.

💡 Solution: A blockchain-based digital royalty platform that automates music play tracking and real-time payment distribution using smart contracts.

🔥 ADVANCED IMPLEMENTATION:

├── register-creative-work(): Register music works and set ownership shares (songwriters, composers, labels).
├── issue-digital-license(): Issue digital licenses to public venues (cafes, hotels, shops) as proof of royalty fee payments.
├── track-music-playback(): Use audio recognition technology (like Shazam) on devices at venues to identify and log every played song.
├── aggregate-royalty-pool(): Collect all funds from venue licenses into a single pool managed by smart contracts.
├── execute-royalty-distribution(): Smart contracts automatically calculate and distribute funds from the pool to digital wallets of rights holders according to play counts.
├── provide-realtime-dashboard(): Provide a transparent dashboard for artists to see where and how often their songs are played and their generated income.
└── manage-rights-ownership(): Facilitate transfer or sale of partial royalty rights as digital assets (e.g., NFTs), with automatic payment rerouting to the new owners.

🎯 User Story:
“As a songwriter, I want a transparent system where I can immediately see when and where my song is played, and receive my royalties quickly and fairly without unclear fee deductions.”

Target Users: Musicians, Songwriters, Producers/Record Labels, Collective Management Organizations (CMOs), Business Owners (Cafes, Hotels, Retail).

Complexity: 🔴 (Hard - legal & technical integration)

Time: 5-6 hours

Why Hard: Requires integration with complex copyright legal frameworks, highly accurate and fraud-resistant audio tracking technology across thousands of locations, and adoption on both market sides (artists and venue owners).
